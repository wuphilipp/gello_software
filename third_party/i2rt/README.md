# I2RT Python API

A Python client library for interacting with [I2RT](https://i2rt.com/) products, designed with simplicity and extensibility in mind.

## Features

- Plug and play python interface for I2RT robots
- Real-time robot control via CAN bus communication
- Support for directly communicating with motor (DM series motors)
- Visualization and gravity compensation using MuJoCo physics engine

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Basic CAN Usage
Plug in the CAN device and run the following command to check the available CAN devices.
```bash
ls -l /sys/class/net/can*
```

This should give you something like this
```bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Jul 15 14:35 /sys/class/net/can0 -> ../../devices/platform/soc/your_can_device/can0
```

Where can0 is the CAN device name.

You need to bring up the CAN interface with
```bash
sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000
```

We have provided a convenience script to reset all CAN devices. Simply run
```bash
sh scripts/reset_all_can.sh
```

### See [set_persist_id_socket_can.md](doc/set_persist_id_socket_can.md) if you want to set persistent CAN device names

## Test YAM Zero Gravity mode

This enables you to launch the robot in zero gravity mode: 
```bash
python i2rt/robots/motor_chain_robot.py --model yam --channel can0 --operation_mode gravity_comp
```

## YAM Robot Arm Usage
Default timeout is enabled for YAM motors. Please refer to [YAM configuration](#yam-configuration) for more details.
### Getting started
```python
from i2rt.robots.motor_chain_robot import get_yam_robot

# Get a robot instance
robot = get_yam_robot(channel="can0", motor_timeout_enabled=True)

# Get the current joint positions
joint_pos = robot.get_joint_pos()

# Command the robot to move to a new joint position
target_pos = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

# Command the robot to move to the target position
robot.command_joint_pos(target_pos)
```

### Running the arm and visualizing it
To launch the follower robot run.
```bash
python scripts/minimum_gello.py --mode follower
```

To launch the robot mujoco visualizer run
```bash
python scripts/minimum_gello.py --mode visualizer
```

### Running the arm on controlling it leader follower style
This requires 2 robot arms.

To launch the follower robot run
```bash
python scripts/minimum_gello.py --mode follower --can_channel can0
```

To launch the leader robot run
```bash
python scripts/minimum_gello.py --mode leader  --can_channel can0
```
### YAM configuration

By default, the arm comes out of the factory with a safety timeout feature enabled. This timeout is set to 200ms, meaning that if the motor does not receive a command within 200ms, it will enter an error state, disable itself, and switch to damping mode. (Contact sales@i2rt.com if you want to disable this feature by default for your bulk order.)

We consider this a safety mechanismâ€”particularly in cases where the CAN connection goes offline. Without this safeguard, gravity compensation under certain configurations could produce positive feedback torque, potentially leading to injury.
However, we understand that this feature may not always be desirable, especially when the arm is intentionally offline. For such cases, we provide a tool to disable the timeout feature.

If your arm has timeout removed, you can run the following command to launch the arm so the arm won't sudden drop during initialization. However, if the arm is offline and is at the gravity compensation mode the arm may move unexpectedly. Please be aware of this risk before removing the timeout.

```bash
python i2rt/robots/motor_chain_robot.py --model yam --channel can0 --operation_mode gravity_comp --motor_timeout_disabled
```

To remove the timeout feature, run the following command.
```bash
python i2rt/motor_config_tool/remove_timeout.py --channel can0
```

To set the timeout feature, run the following command.
```bash
python i2rt/motor_config_tool/set_timeout.py --channel can0 --timeout
```

We also provide a tool to zero the motor offsets.
```bash
python i2rt/motor_config_tool/set_zero.py --channel can0 --motor_id 1
```
After moving the timeout, you can initialize the YAM arm with the following command.
```python
from i2rt.robots.motor_chain_robot import get_yam_robot

# Get a robot instance
robot = get_yam_robot(channel="can0", motor_timeout_enabled=False)
```

## Flow Base Usage

### Running the demo
You can control your flow base using a game controller.
To run the joystick demo, run the following command.
```bash
python i2rt/flow_base/flow_base_controller.py
```

### Getting started
```python
from i2rt.flow_base.flow_base_controller import Vehicle

# Get a robot instance
vehicle = Vehicle()
vehicle.start_control()

# move forward slowly for 1 second
start_time = time.time()
while time.time() - start_time < 1:
    user_cmd = (0.1, 0, 0)
    vehicle.set_target_velocity(user_cmd, frame="local")
```
